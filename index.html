      <p> I am a musician, teacher and now an aspiring web developer in Dallas, Texas. Musically I enjoy playing jazz
        and blues, as well as writing in many styles.
        I have been teaching for over 5 years, and have taught students of all ages at several studios. I have
        played in several bands in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and enjoy collaboration.</p>
        <p>As a developer I hope to bring creative and logical solutions to my workplace. I also would like to bring my
          spirit of teamwork and collaboration that I have learned from working in bands to the tech field.
          As an active learner I am looking forward to learning more everyday throughout my career.</p>
